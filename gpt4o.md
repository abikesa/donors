**Title:** Outcomes for Living Kidney Donors Following Donor Nephrectomy in Aotearoa New Zealand: A 30-year Retrospective Cohort Study

**Journal:** Kidney International Reports

**General Comments:**

This manuscript presents a comprehensive retrospective cohort study examining the outcomes of living kidney donors over a 30-year period in New Zealand. The study fills a significant gap in the literature by providing contemporary data on post-donation outcomes in a non-USA/non-European population. The data linkage approach, using multiple national databases, ensures a robust analysis and minimizes the risk of lost follow-up. The findings are crucial for informing potential donors and healthcare providers about the risks associated with kidney donation in New Zealand.

**Strengths:**

1. **Comprehensive Data Collection:** The study's extensive data collection from multiple sources, including the NZ Blood Service, Ministry of Health, hospital records, and the ANZDATA registry, ensures a high level of accuracy and completeness.

2. **Long Follow-Up Period:** The 30-year follow-up period provides valuable insights into both short-term and long-term outcomes for living kidney donors.

3. **Detailed Analysis:** The manuscript provides a thorough analysis of primary and secondary outcomes, including kidney failure, death, cardiovascular disease, and acute complications. The use of sensitivity analyses strengthens the reliability of the findings.

4. **Contextual Relevance:** By focusing on a New Zealand population, the study offers relevant data that can guide local clinical practices and donor counseling.

**Specific Comments:**

1. **Abstract:**
   - The abstract is well-structured and provides a clear summary of the study's background, methods, results, and conclusions. Consider adding specific numbers for the primary and secondary outcomes to enhance the abstract's informativeness.

2. **Introduction:**
   - The introduction effectively sets the stage for the study by highlighting the importance of understanding donor outcomes and the lack of such data in non-USA/non-European populations. It might benefit from a brief mention of the specific demographic and healthcare system characteristics of New Zealand that make this study particularly relevant.

3. **Methods:**
   - The methods section is detailed and transparent. The use of deterministic and probabilistic linkage for data integration is well-explained. Consider providing a flowchart of the data linkage process to visually represent the steps involved.

4. **Results:**
   - The results are presented clearly and concisely. The use of Kaplan-Meier survival curves and cumulative incidence curves is appropriate and aids in the interpretation of the data. It might be useful to include a table summarizing the baseline characteristics of the donors to give a clearer picture of the study population.

5. **Discussion:**
   - The discussion provides a balanced interpretation of the findings, comparing them with previous studies and highlighting the implications for clinical practice. The acknowledgment of limitations, such as the use of administrative datasets and lack of a control group, demonstrates a critical approach. Consider expanding on potential strategies for future research to address these limitations.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The conclusion succinctly summarizes the key findings and their importance for informed decision-making among potential kidney donors and healthcare providers.

**Minor Issues:**

1. **Formatting:**
   - Ensure that all tables and figures are referenced in the text and formatted according to the journal's guidelines. For example, Table 1 and Table 2 are not mentioned in the text. Figures 1-4 need clearer references in the relevant sections of the results and discussion.

2. **Abbreviations:**
   - Provide a list of abbreviations used in the manuscript for easy reference. For instance, ANZDATA and ICD codes are frequently used but not immediately defined.

3. **Typographical Errors:**
   - On page 5, line 10, the phrase "incidence rate of KF was 3 per 10,000 person-years" should specify "kidney failure" instead of using the abbreviation "KF" for clarity.
   - On page 7, line 24, the word "complications" is repeated twice in the phrase "complications complications within 90 days".
   - On page 13, line 2, "major categories" should be "major and minor categories" for consistency with the categorization method used in the results.

**Overall Recommendation:**

This manuscript provides valuable insights into the long-term outcomes of living kidney donors in New Zealand. The study is methodologically sound, and the findings are highly relevant for clinical practice. I recommend this manuscript for publication after addressing the minor issues noted above.
