**Title:** Outcomes for Living Kidney Donors Following Donor Nephrectomy in Aotearoa New Zealand: A 30-year Retrospective Cohort Study

**Journal:** Kidney International Reports

**General Comments:**

This manuscript presents a comprehensive retrospective cohort study examining the outcomes of living kidney donors over a 30-year period in New Zealand. The study fills a significant gap in the literature by providing contemporary data on post-donation outcomes in a non-USA/non-European population. The data linkage approach, using multiple national databases, ensures a robust analysis and minimizes the risk of lost follow-up. The findings are crucial for informing potential donors and healthcare providers about the risks associated with kidney donation in New Zealand.

**Strengths:**

1. **Comprehensive Data Collection:** The study's extensive data collection from multiple sources, including the NZ Blood Service, Ministry of Health, hospital records, and the ANZDATA registry, ensures a high level of accuracy and completeness.

2. **Long Follow-Up Period:** The 30-year follow-up period provides valuable insights into both short-term and long-term outcomes for living kidney donors.

3. **Detailed Analysis:** The manuscript provides a thorough analysis of primary and secondary outcomes, including kidney failure, death, cardiovascular disease, and acute complications. The use of sensitivity analyses strengthens the reliability of the findings.

4. **Contextual Relevance:** By focusing on a New Zealand population, the study offers relevant data that can guide local clinical practices and donor counseling.

**Specific Comments:**

1. **Abstract:**
   - The abstract is well-structured and provides a clear summary of the study's background, methods, results, and conclusions. Consider adding specific numbers for the primary and secondary outcomes to enhance the abstract's informativeness.
   - The sentence "Studies of donor outcomes are largely restricted to donations prior to 2010 in the USA" is inaccurate. Massie et al, Association of Early Postdonation Renal Function With Subsequent Risk of End-Stage Renal Disease in Living Kidney Donors, JAMA Surgery, 2020 includes 71,468 US living kidney donors followed for ESRD between 1999-2018.
   - What is novel is the New Zealand registry and wide range of outcomes including death, cardiovascular disease, perioperative complications, and kidney failure all in one national registry study.
   - But the study population (N=1339) is too small to study rare outcomes in the very highly select, healthy donors. We know this from US and European literature. And thus most of the estimates reported are imprecise (i.e., have wide confidence intervals)

2. **Introduction:**
   - The introduction effectively sets the stage for the study by highlighting the importance of understanding donor outcomes and the lack of such data in non-USA/non-European populations. It might benefit from a brief mention of the specific demographic and healthcare system characteristics of New Zealand that make this study particularly relevant, or distinct from US and Europe, which dominate the literature.

3. **Methods:**
   - The methods section is detailed and transparent. The use of deterministic and probabilistic linkage for data integration is well-explained. The flowchart of the data linkage process helps visually represent the steps involved.

4. **Results:**
   - The results are presented clearly and concisely. The use of Kaplan-Meier survival curves and cumulative incidence curves is appropriate and aids in the interpretation of the data. It might be useful to include a table summarizing the baseline characteristics of the donors to give a clearer picture of the study population.
   - For consistency with the literature and other incidence metrics in the paper, please report mortality rather than survival (e.g. 1% mortality at 10 years rather than 99% survival at 10 years)
   - Incidence of kidney failure, cardiovascular disease and mortality is not constant in the postdonation period (Anjum et al, reference #22 of this study. As such, metrics derived from methods that assume constant hazards (i.e., rates reported in person-years) are inappropriate. Kaplan-Meier methods, Cox regression, and other methods that can capture and visualize changing hazard rates over time are preferred. The limited statistical power of the study might be a limitation, making it difficult to use these methods.
   - Figure 2 of Cumulative hazard of kidney failure after live kidney donation must be improved. The y-axis should be rescaled to per 10,000 rather than where it stands as a proportion from 0 to 1. This is inconsistent with the manuscript text, the literature, and intuition given how rare the events are.
   - Figure 3 should be presented as mortality rather than survival. The y-axis should be appropriately scaled to not exceed 25%.
   - Figure 4 appropriately "zooms in", allowing us to visualize the data. But the y-axis should be rescaled to be consistent with the literature, the text, and intuition (e.g. per 100 or per 10,000).

5. **Discussion:**
   - The discussion provides a balanced interpretation of the findings, comparing them with previous studies and highlighting the implications for clinical practice. The acknowledgment of limitations, such as the use of administrative datasets and lack of a control group, demonstrates a critical approach. Consider expanding on potential strategies for future research to address these limitations.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The conclusion succinctly summarizes the key findings and their importance for informed decision-making among potential kidney donors and healthcare providers. However, the absence of a control population against which to contextualize "low risk of kidney failure" is the major limitation of this study. 


**Overall Recommendation:**

This manuscript provides some insights into the long-term outcomes of living kidney donors in New Zealand. Although the better methods might be used (Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression), the donor population in New Zealand might be too small to permit these better methods. However, I recommend this manuscript for publication after addressing the minor issues noted above and acknowledging the limitations.

General Comments:

This manuscript examines the outcomes of living kidney donors over a 30-year period in New Zealand. The study fills a significant gap in the literature by providing contemporary data on post-donation outcomes in a non-USA/non-European population. The data linkage approach, using multiple national databases, ensures a robust analysis and minimizes the risk of lost follow-up. But the study isn't sufficiently powered to conduct multivariable adjusted regression and to investigate risk factors for the various outcomes investigated. Such an approach would be crucial for informing individual potential donors about the risks associated with kidney donation in New Zealand.

Strengths:

- Extensive data collection from multiple sources, including the NZ Blood Service, Ministry of Health, hospital records, and the ANZDATA registry, ensures a high level of accuracy and completeness.

- 30-year follow-up period provides valuable insights into both short-term and long-term outcomes for living kidney donors.

- The manuscript provides an analysis of primary and secondary outcomes, including kidney failure, death, cardiovascular disease, and acute complications all in one manuscript.

- Focusing on a New Zealand population, the study offers relevant data that can guide local clinical practices and donor counseling.

Specific Comments:

1. Abstract:
   - The sentence "Studies of donor outcomes are largely restricted to donations prior to 2010 in the USA" is inaccurate. Massie et al, Association of Early Postdonation Renal Function With Subsequent Risk of End-Stage Renal Disease in Living Kidney Donors, JAMA Surgery, 2020 includes 71,468 US living kidney donors followed for ESRD between 1999-2018.
   - What is novel is the New Zealand registry and wide range of outcomes including death, cardiovascular disease, perioperative complications, and kidney failure all in one national registry study.
   - But the study population (N=1339) is too small to study rare outcomes in the very highly select, healthy donors. We know this from US and European literature. And thus most of the estimates reported are imprecise (i.e., have wide confidence intervals)
   - No "risk factors" are investigated in a multivariable framework, which is quite surprising and a major limitation of approach. The sample size may also limit the authors ability to utilize this approach.

2. Introduction:
   - The introduction effectively sets the stage for the study by highlighting the importance of understanding donor outcomes and the lack of such data in non-USA/non-European populations. It might benefit from a brief mention of the specific demographic and healthcare system characteristics of New Zealand that make this study particularly relevant, or distinct from US and Europe, which dominate the literature.

3. Methods:
   - The methods section is detailed and transparent. The use of deterministic and probabilistic linkage for data integration is well-explained. The flowchart of the data linkage process helps visually represent the steps involved.
   - Mulativariable adjusted Cox regression is something of a standard in clinical literature. It isn't used here. The alternative is Kaplan-Meier methods with subgroups to reveal risk factors in a univariable framework (e.g. in references #11, #12, and #13

4. Results:
- For consistency with the literature and other incidence metrics in the paper, please report mortality rather than survival (e.g. 1% mortality at 10 years rather than 99% survival at 10 years)
   - Incidence of kidney failure, cardiovascular disease and mortality is not constant in the postdonation period (Anjum et al, reference #22 of this study. As such, metrics derived from methods that assume constant hazards (i.e., rates reported in person-years) are inappropriate. Kaplan-Meier methods, Cox regression, and other methods that can capture and visualize changing hazard rates over time are preferred. The limited statistical power of the study might be a limitation, making it difficult to use these methods.
   - Figure 2 of Cumulative hazard of kidney failure after live kidney donation must be improved. The y-axis should be rescaled to per 10,000 rather than where it stands as a proportion from 0 to 1. This is inconsistent with the manuscript text, the literature, and intuition given how rare the events are.
   - Figure 3 should be presented as mortality rather than survival. The y-axis should be appropriately scaled to not exceed 25%.
   - Figure 4 appropriately "zooms in", allowing us to visualize the data. But the y-axis should be rescaled to be consistent with the literature, the text, and intuition (e.g. per 100 or per 10,000).

5. Discussion:
   - The acknowledgment of limitations, such as the use of administrative datasets and lack of a control group, demonstrates a critical approach. But this review outlines many other limitations that must be discussed, if the authors can't address them.

6. Conclusion:
   - The conclusion makes no statement about risk factors or sub-group risk. Does this mean all potential donors will be treated identically? Also, the absence of a control population against which to contextualize "low risk of kidney failure" is the major limitation of this study. Wouldn't potential donors in New Zealand rather be informed about the risk factors identified in European and American studies? This paper fails to approach the literature with this sort of knowledge gap in mind. 

Overall Recommendation:

The only novelty here is the population studied. But the methods, approach, and inferences are sub-par when compared with the rich literature documenting donor outcomes. If the authors could address the outlined limitations, then perhaps this manuscript might be cited as one that shows consistent results regardless of geography (as we see with European vs. American literature on this topic).
