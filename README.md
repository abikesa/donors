TITLE: Outcomes for living kidney donors following donor nephrectomy in Aotearoa New Zealand: A 30-year retrospective cohort study

AUTHORS: Chan, Lai Wan; Irish, Georgina; Goh, Tze; Alnasrallah, Basil; Davies, Christopher; Sypek, Matthew P; Clayton, Philip; Collins, Michael

ABSTRACT: Background: Living donor kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for people with kidney failure. Because living kidney donors do not derive health benefits from donation, contemporary and relevant information on post-donation outcomes need inform decision-making. Studies of donor outcomes are largely restricted to donations prior to 2010 in the USA and Europe. We studied donors over a 30-year period in Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ) to investigate short and long-term outcomes in a contemporary non-USA/non-European population.
Methods: This was a retrospective observational cohort study of all living kidney donors in NZ (1988-2018). The primary outcome was the incidence of kidney failure. Secondary outcomes were death, cardiovascular disease, and the incidence of complications within 90 days after nephrectomy. Donors were identified using multiple data sources: the NZ Blood Service, the Ministry of Health, hospital records, and the Australia and New Zealand Live Kidney Donor (ANZLKD) Registry. Outcomes were determined via data linkage with Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA) for kidney failure and with the NZ Ministry of Health using ICD coding for other outcomes. Follow-up was until 31st December 2019.
Results: 1339 people donated a kidney from 1988-2018. During 16,272 person-years of follow-up, 5 people developed kidney failure, an incidence of 3 per 10,000 person-years (95% CI 1.3-7.4). Patient survival was 99% (98.2-99.5) at 10 years; 30 people died during follow-up. The incidence of cardiovascular disease was 11.6 (95% CI 7.4-19.2) per 10,000 person-years. 292 donors (22%) experienced a complication following donor nephrectomy and 69 (5%) required intervention.
